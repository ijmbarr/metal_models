# Metal Model

A collection of models to generate metal lyrics. Full details of what's going on can be found in [this blog post](http://www.degeneratestate.org/posts/2016/Sep/12/heavy-metal-and-natural-language-processing-part-2/).

The notebook models.ipynb gives some examples of how to use the models. 

Due to the size of the 15 character Markov model, it was commited as a compressed file. To use this model, it needs to be extracted and placed in the models/ directory. 

The models built in Keras should in theory be usable with different versions and different backends, but I have noticed some minor inconsistancies. It is suggested that the versions in requirements.txt are used.
